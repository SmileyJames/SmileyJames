ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm a software engineer focused on full-stack web development: from the importance in indexing the back-endâ€™s database to the importance of accessible mark-up on the frontend.

Currently working primarily on a React JavaScript codebase at the moment. Also, experienced in Django Python.
