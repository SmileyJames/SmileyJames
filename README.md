ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

My name is James O'Toole, and I am a software consultant specializing in GPT, React, Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS. I have a strong passion for developing robust solutions, and strive to stay at the cutting edge of technology. 

I am a big proponent of the idea of â€˜release early and oftenâ€™. I believe in putting out smaller, frequent updates, rather than longer periods of development and more sporadic releases. This approach allows for more feedback and faster iteration of new features, leading to a more efficient development cycle.

I'm a firm believer in the importance of computer-human interaction. In my opinion, this is one of the most important aspects of software development, as it helps ensure the end product is usable and intuitive for the user. I'm passionate about creating applications that people can easily interact with and enjoy.

I'm also a big fan of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). The ability to write automated tests and get quick feedback on the functionality of applications is invaluable. With BDD, I like to use Gherkin to write out user scenarios, and with TDD I use Jest to create unit tests.

In addition to the more technical aspects, I'm also extremely interested in measuring outcomes, performance, errors, and crashes. Being able to quantify the success or failure of a project does wonders for the morale of the development team. Usability testing is also a great way to gain insight into how real users interact with an application.

Finally, I'm a huge advocate for Extreme Programming (XP) practices. I believe in teaching others how to go about structuring, managing, and maintaining successful software projects. From understanding the Agile development process to using pair programming, XP is a great tool for any software development team.

Overall, my career has been focused on the development and maintenance of software products and applications.  With a passion for creating user-friendly and reliable applications, I'm sure I can help any team create success.
